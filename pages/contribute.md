# 为 Kotlin 贡献力量

Kotlin is an open-source project under the [Apache 2.0 License](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/master/license/LICENSE.txt). The source code, tooling, documentation, and even this web site are maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/jetbrains/kotlin). 
While Kotlin is mostly developed by JetBrains, there are hundreds of external contributors to the Kotlin project and we are always on the lookout for more people to help us.

## Participate in Early Access Preview

You can help us improve Kotlin by [participating in Kotlin Early Access Preview (EAP)](/eap/index.html) and providing us with your valuable feedback.
 
For every release, Kotlin ships a few preview builds where you can try out the latest features before they go to production. You can report any bugs you find to our issue tracker [YouTrack](https://kotl.in/issue) 
and we will try to fix them before a final release. This way, you can get bug fixes earlier than the standard Kotlin release cycle.

## Contribute to the compiler, standard library, and tooling

If you want to contribute to the Kotlin compiler, standard library, or tooling, go to [GitHub](https://github.com/jetbrains/kotlin), check out the latest Kotlin version,
 and follow [the instructions on how to contribute](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/master/docs/contributing.md).
 
You can help us by completing [open tasks](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/KT?q=tag:%20%7BUp%20For%20Grabs%7D%20and%20State:%20Open). 
Please keep an open line of communication with us because we may have questions and comments on your changes. Otherwise, we won't be able to incorporate your contributions.

## Contribute to other libraries and create your own

Besides the standard library that provides core capabilities, Kotlin has a number of additional (kotlinx) libraries that extend its functionality. 
Each kotlinx library is developed in a separate repository, has its own versioning and release cycle.

If you want to contribute to a kotlinx library, follow the contribution process described for each library, such as [kotlinx.coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines),
 [kotlinx.serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), and [ktor](https://github.com/ktorio/ktor/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you have a library that could be useful to other Kotlin developers, let us know via <feedback@kotlinlang.org>.

## Contribute to the documentation

If you've found an issue in [the Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/), 
feel free to check out [the documentation source code on GitHub](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-web-site/tree/master/pages/docs)
and send us a pull request. Please keep an open line of communication with us because we may have questions and comments on your changes. 
Otherwise, we won't be able to incorporate your contributions. 

The documentation site is built using Markdown and Jekyll. 

## Create tutorials or videos

If you've created tutorials or videos for Kotlin, please share them with us via <feedback@kotlinlang.org>. 


## Translate documentation to other languages

You are welcome to translate the Kotlin documentation into your own language and publish the translation on your website.
However, we won't be able to host your translation in the main repository and publish it on [kotlinlang.org](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/).

This site is the official documentation for the language, and we ensure that all the information here
is correct and up to date. Unfortunately, we won't be able to review documentation in other languages. 

**译注**：补充或改善中文站（即本站）翻译，可以 fork [Kotlin 语言中文站](https://github.com/hltj/kotlin-web-site-cn)项目并提 Pull Request。
目前《翻译指南》还在制订中，不过 [#35](https://github.com/hltj/kotlin-web-site-cn/issues/35) 有一些草稿，
初次翻译请务必先阅读 [#35](https://github.com/hltj/kotlin-web-site-cn/issues/35) 及其中链接对应的内容。

## Hold events and presentations

If you've given or just plan to give presentations or hold events on Kotlin, please fill out [the form](https://surveys.jetbrains.com/s3/Submit-a-Kotlin-Talk). We'll feature them on [the event list](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/events.html).
